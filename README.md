# matrix-pixelart
Script to generate colorful text messages out of .ppm images for Riot.im

How i use it:

1. Export an image as a .ppm file 

2. Run the script and copy the output

       $ node matrix-pixelart.js path/to/image.ppm | xclip
    
3. Run /devtools in Riot.im (matrix client)

4. Enter 'm.room.message' as the event type

5. Paste the output in the event content field

6. Press send and wait a couple of seconds =)

### Known issues:

- Different applications encode ppm files in different ways, this script contains was only tested with files generated by GIMP and imagemagick(commented out).
You might need to adjust a couple of variables if your file isn't correctly parsed.

- Because each pixel (1:1 aspect ratio) gets transformed into a block character (vertical aspect ratio),
expect your source images to become deformed. A workaround is to stretch the image out horizontally before exporting.

- Matrix instances don't usually support very long messages, if you want to send a very tall image it might be a good idea to split it in chunks.

- Riot.im will wrap long lines, so be careful to keep the width of your input image to a minimum
